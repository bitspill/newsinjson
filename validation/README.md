# Validation
ninjs documents can be validated using [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org).

The IPTC maintains a schema for each release of the ninjs standard. IPTC ninjs schemas can be found [here](http://www.iptc.org/std/ninjs/).

The most recent ninjs specification file is available at
http://www.iptc.org/std/ninjs/ninjs-schema_1.0.json
