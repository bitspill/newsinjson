# Validation
ninjs documents can be validated using [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org).

The IPTC maintains a schema for each release of the ninjs standard. IPTC schemas can be found on the IPTC web site. (TODO: add the URL)


# Examples
This directory contains code demonstrating how to validate ninjs documents in different programming languages.
