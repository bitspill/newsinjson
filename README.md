ninjs - News in JSON
====================

ninjs is [http://www.iptc.org/](IPTC)'s standard for describing news
content in JSON format.

The ninjs JSON Schema is available in this repository and at
http://www.iptc.org/std/ninjs/ninjs-schema_1.2.json

More extensive documentation, created from the source files in the
documentation folder in this repository, can be found at
https://www.iptc.org/std/ninjs/userguide/

Examples
--------

The `examples` folder contains example files, including some supplied
by Business Wire. Examples show how NewsML 1.2 files convert to their
equivalents in ninjs.

Unit tests
